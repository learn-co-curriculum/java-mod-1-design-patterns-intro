## What are Design Patterns?

As we gain more programming experience and the systems we build are increasingly
more complex, we can build on the experience of people who have come before us
by implementing patterns that have evolved over decades of experience.

**Design patterns** provide specific solutions for specific problems. They
describe ways in which features of Java can be leveraged to solve well known
problems with flexible and mature solutions.

There are many design patterns, and you will continue to learn them as you make
progress in your career. We will introduce you to several essential ones here
and go through examples to see how they might apply in actual systems.
